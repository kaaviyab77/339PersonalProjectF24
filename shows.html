                <p>This is a series that I discovered pretty recently and I absolutely love binging this show. Although
                    at times this show has some conservitive views that I don't agree with, it is still an enjoyable

                <h3>Overlord - 2015-2022</h3>
                <p>This is technically an on going series with a movie that very recently came out. This show is very
                    interesting and funny. It is fun to watch a normal man trapped inside an undead body being revered
                    by overpowered characters and try to navigate a completely new world with a very different system.

                    The final hour of the popular virtual reality game Yggdrasil has come. However, Momonga, a powerful
                    wizard and master of the dark guild Ainz Ooal Gown, decides to spend his last few moments in the
                    game as the servers begin to shut down. To his surprise, despite the clock having struck midnight,
                    Momonga is still fully conscious as his character and, moreover, the non-player characters appear to
                    have developed personalities of their own. Confronted with this abnormal situation, Momonga commands
                    his loyal servants to help him investigate and take control of this new world, with the hopes of
                    figuring out what has caused this development and if there may be others in the same predicament.

                <p>This is a show based around a time loop and it is very intriguing and really takes a look at the
                    character Nadia, and how she reevaluates her life. This is a overall very serious series with very
                    light comedy, but still a very enjoyable watch.</p>

                <p>This show is very interesting, it jumps back and forth in the timeline and kinda shows the true
                    nature of people and how they would act when given too much power. It also questions how much
                    athourity a teacher should have, and in the name of prolonging someone's life, is it okay to
                    imprision them? The main character is fun and inspiring and I highly recommend watching this anime.

                    The character-driven cartoon chronicles the nautical and often nonsensical adventures of SpongeBob,
                    an incurably optimistic and earnest sea sponge, and his underwater friends. Dwelling a few fathoms
                    beneath the tropical isle of Bikini Atoll in the sub-surface city of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob lives
                    in a two-story pineapple. Instead of taking the logical approach to everyday challenges, SpongeBob
                    approaches life in a wayward and unconventional way. Whether searching for the ultimate spatula to
                    perfect his burger flipping technique at the Krusty Krab or just hanging out with his best friend
                    Patrick (an amiable starfish), SpongeBob's good intentions and overzealous approach to life usually
                    create chaos in his underwater world.

                    Welcome to Elmore. This quaint little suburb isn't quite what it seems, as in Elmore, just about
                    everything has the ability to come to life. The Amazing World of Gumball follows the misadventures
                    of Gumball, 12-year-old cat. With help from best friend Darwin, his former pet goldfish that grew
                    legs and joined the family, he gets into all sorts of antics. He is joined by his sister Anais, a
                    four-year-old bunny with heightened intelligence. His parents, Richard and Nicole, provide him
                    support as well.

                    great pasing and you can feel the tension building until it explodes. This show will keep you

                    At Grace Field House, life couldn't be better for the orphans. Though they have no parents, together
                    with the other kids and a kind "Mama" who cares for them, they form one big, happy family. No child
                    is ever overlooked, especially since they are all adopted by the age of 12. Their daily lives
                    involve rigorous tests, but afterwards, they are allowed to play outside. There is only one rule
                    they must obey: do not leave the orphanage. But one day, two top-scoring orphans, Emma and Norman,
                    venture past the gate and unearth the harrowing secret behind their entire existence. Utilizing
                    their quick-wittedness, the children must work together to somehow change their predetermined fate.

                    and he passes away in the process. Wei Wuxian reappears sixteen years later, and works together with

                    with a hatred for beauty, embracing all things morbid and occult-related. She is sent to live in her
                    aunt's mansion which, to her dismay, she'll share with four exceedingly handsome boys her age.
                    Furthermore, her flighty aunt has made a deal with these boys that in exchange for living there
                    rent-free, they are to turn Sunako into a proper lady by the time she returns from a trip around the
                    world. Thus begins Sunako's hectic life with abrasive Kyohei Takano, ladies' man Ranmaru Morii, calm
                    Takenaga Oda, and friendly Yukinojo Toyama. As she interacts with them she finds them less
                    obnoxious, and she may not be as much of an outcast as she thought.

                    Four young women begin life at university. Although they are firm friends, they are very different
                    in almost every regard. Xia Lang Lang (Shen Yue) is tomboyish, obstinate, and supremely logical. But
                    as she begins her tertiary educational journey, she discovers that she also has a softer side - and
                    that romance might also play a role in her life. Meanwhile, Huang Fu Shu Min (Zhang Ruo Nan) is
                    always the heroine of her own story. Acting cute and dependent is her strong suit, and independence
                    is not something she has ever been familiar with. But she soon understands that her university
                    journey could well lead her on the path to independence. Then there's Fan Xiao Yu (Vivienne Tien) -
                    an intelligent young woman and a renowned beauty from a wealthy family. But she has always toed the
                    line, respecting her family's wishes, despite the fact that deep down, she wants to break free. When
                    she begins to explore the world of business with a fellow student, she realizes that she might yet
                    attain freedom - and maybe romance, too. Rounding off the quartet is Yang Jia Qian (Zhang Xin Yi),
                    who always gives off the impression of being mature beyond her years. But she has a range of hidden
                    thoughts and feelings that are now ready to come to the fore now she is no longer under the watchful
                    eye of her family.
