        <p class="text-box">
            Here are some of my favorite books. This will be a combination of graphic novels to actual novels. These
            books are organized in the order in which I discovered them. So the first couple books will be from my
            childhood and the books later on will be books that I am currently reading, or am looking forward to

                    This is a children's series that was very prominent when I was a child. I really enjoyed the
                    illistrations and when I was espcially young my parents would read this book when I was young.

                    This series was a series that I would often checkout from my school library with my friends. I
                    honestly didn't really read the books that much, I mostly just checked out the books to fit in with
                    my friends. Even though I didn't often read the books, its still a pretty prominent part of my early
                    childhood.

                    "Jason has a problem. He doesn’t remember anything before waking up on a school bus holding hands
                    with a girl. Apparently she’s his girlfriend Piper, his best friend is a kid named Leo, and they’re
                    all students in the Wilderness School, a boarding school for “bad kids.” What he did to end up here,
                    Jason has no idea—except that everything seems very wrong.
                    <br>
                    Piper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, and her vivid nightmares reveal that
                    he’s in terrible danger. Now her boyfriend doesn’t recognize her, and when a freak storm and strange
                    creatures attack during a school field trip, she, Jason, and Leo are whisked away to someplace
                    called Camp Half-Blood. What is going on?
                    <br>
                    Leo has a way with tools. His new cabin at Camp Half-Blood is filled with them. Seriously, the place
                    beats Wilderness School hands down, with its weapons training, monsters, and fine-looking girls.
                    What’s troubling is the curse everyone keeps talking about, and that a camper’s gone missing.
                    Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist they are all—including Leo—related to a god."

                    Summary by Daniel Eavanson on
                    <a
                        href="https://www.toomanythoughtsmedia.com/one-piece-manga-by-eiichiro-oda-book-review/">toomanythoughtsmedia.com</a>:

                    Though One Piece sells itself as a comedy adventure comic, it is filled with hidden depth and
                    complexity. The main character, Monkey D. Luffy, helps maintain that comedic edge. He is a character
                    that never wants to grow up and experiences the world with the perspective of childlike wonder and
                    awe. Also like a child, he smashes his way into things and declares his simplistic world view much
                    to the gap jawed reaction of the rest of the world.
                    <br>
                    For example, slavery. Slavery exists in the world of One Piece and it is maintained by an
                    authoritarian ruling class that uses massive military force to enforce its will on the rest of the
                    world. Most of the people that we meet in the world are appalled and refuse to participate in
                    slavery, but they also tolerate it. They live in cities and around the people that have slaves and
                    in many cases torture and mistreat their slaves out in the open. Luffy sees this one time, and
                    immediately starts throwing punches. This is One Piece at it is best. Showing us the complexity of
                    our own world and reminding us that sometime simple solutions are what is needed.
                    <br>
                    One Piece is a book about resistance and making your own path, often literally, through the world.
                    The crew of the Merry Go are fun people, but each with their own back story and character paths to
                    bring to the story. Over the many decades that the 100 volumes have released in, they have grown and
                    changed and witnessed amazing things, all while trying to achieve an ambiguous goal that rarely
                    stretches beyond the thirst for the next adventure.
                    <br>
                    It is not without fault. As is often the case in manga, the visual imagery for the many female
                    characters is overly sexualized. You will notice that in most of the covers, so you should not need
                    to read a bunch of volumes to know if it will bother you. I cannot defend it. But I think that
                    there’s enough of a loony toons nature of the story to feel that these exaggerated physical details
                    are in line with the aesthetic of the world, and it doesn’t distract from the story for me (I say as
                    a man).

                    <br>
                    Overlord is a story about a Japanese salaryman (a businessman) who plays a virtual online game
                    called Yggdrasil. Inside this game he plays an undead character named Momonga who leads a non-human
                    guild called Ainz Ooal Gown.
                    <br>
                    The story begins as he logs on for the last time. The servers of Yggdrasil are shutting down and he
                    wanted to see off the fun times he had. Only one other previous member arrives and leaves, but he
                    alone stays. However, he’s with his NPCs in his throne room.
                    <br>
                    As the server shutdown clocks down, Momonga closes his eyes and drifts to sleep. When he opens his
                    eyes again, he’s inside of a world closely resembling Yggdrasil, and his NPCs are alive.
                    <br>
                    Overlord seems like it would get old quickly, but the main character walks the line between
                    “overpowered main character” and “demon lord”. He doesn’t want to take over the world, but he may
                    not have a choice. He loves his NPCs, since he loves his formed guildmates, and wants to take care
                    of them. The NPCs, in turn, see the guildmembers as gods, and Momonga as the greatest of them.
                    <br>
                    And there’s also the matter of the world that they now exist in. It has its own political situation
                    and power struggles. Because of that, a new and unknown sorcerer appearing on the scene could tip
                    the balance and lead to war.
                    <br>
                    There’s many elements to the story that are interesting, but the worldbuilding is some of the
                    deepest in any light novel. I would argue this book is on the level of a normal western fantasy
                    novel, given much of the political intrigue and lore.

                    I used to be a normal high school girl but in the blink of an eye, I woke up in a place I've never
                    seen before and-and I was reborn as a spider?! How could something that's nothing more than a tiny
                    spider (that's me) possibly survive in literally the worst dungeon ever? Are there no rules? There
                    should be some rules! Who the hell is responsible for this? SHOW YOUR FACE!
