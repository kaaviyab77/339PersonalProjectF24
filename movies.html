                <h3>Bahubali The Beginning - 2015</h3>
                <p>This movie was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, Indian movies ever made. This
                    movie was officially released in 4 different languages and was an expierence to watch. It was one of
                    the first indian movies that felt comparable to a Hollywood movie that I have seen in awhile. And
                    the story and twists of the movie just keeps you watching. This movie had a cast of very strong
                    actors and the settings where breath taking and only sucked you in further into the movie. This
                    movie is only the first of the 2 part series.</p>

                <h3>Chandramukhi - 2005</h3>
                <p>This movie came out almost 2 decades ago, yet it is one of my all time favorite movies. I did not
                    fully watch this movie until I was 13 or so, and it instatnly become one of my favorites. This movie
                    is not beloved by me because of its horror elements, but rather its comedy. The plot is pretty
                    standard, and the horror effects, is not very scary, but the comedy carries this entire movie and
                    will keep you laughing at the same jokes even decades later.</p>

                    because this movie is really hard to find for some reason. If you are able to I would highly
                    recommend watching this movie. IT has very good music and is another funny movie. It also shows a
                    female character as being mentally strong and very smart. It overall is just an amazong watch.</p>
